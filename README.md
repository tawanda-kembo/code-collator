# Code Collator

Code Collator is a powerful CLI tool designed to streamline your code review and documentation process by collating your entire codebase into a single, organised Markdown file. This is particularly useful for sharing with AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude for analysis, troubleshooting, or documentation.

## Use Case

Have you ever needed to provide a comprehensive overview of your codebase for a code review, AI analysis, or detailed documentation? Code Collator simplifies this task by aggregating all your code files into a single Markdown file. This makes it easy to:

- Generate a unified document for code reviews or team collaboration.
- Create comprehensive documentation for your projects with minimal effort.

## Features
